# Introduction
This GitHub repo is about face verification. To tackle this subject, I chose to start with the MNIST dataset. The goal here is to understand how to use the *Siamese Network* method. At the end, each digit of the MNIST dataset is expected to be encoding into a 128d embedding vector where each digit embedding vector is grouped in a 128d space with its fellows.

The concepts won't be explain in detail here but in the [main project '#TODO']().
